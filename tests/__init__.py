"""Tests for the rolling package.

To run tests, use `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
or its successor `nose2 <https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/>`_
which will resolve import path problems. Running the nose script from the project root will set the python path to look
at the package as an external import would.
